How Prepaid Water Meters Are Supposed to Work
</h3>
<p className="text-blog-bento_text text-pretty">
Prepaid water meters operate similarly to prepaid phone services: users pay in advance for a specific amount of water, which the meter deducts based on usage. This system is designed to promote efficient water use and help consumers manage their consumption.

The Problem with Malawi Water Board's Prepaid Meters
</h3>
<p className="text-blog-bento_text text-base text-pretty">
Customers have reported significant variations in water volumes for the same payment amount. For instance, paying MWK4,000 could result in receiving 0.50 cubic meters of water at one time and 1.90 cubic meters at another. This inconsistency is not just inconvenient but points to deeper issues within the system.

Potential Causes of Discrepancies
</h3>
<p className="text-blog-bento_text text-pretty">
1. <strong>Software Glitches</strong>: Software faults are a common cause of inconsistencies in prepaid meters. These meters rely on sophisticated software for accurate billing, and any bugs can lead to incorrect calculations.
</p>
<p className="text-blog-bento_text text-pretty mt-2">
2. <strong>Meter Calibration Issues</strong>: Meters need regular calibration to ensure accurate readings. Inaccurate calibration, whether from initial setup issues or wear and tear, can cause discrepancies in water volume measurements.
</p>
<p className="text-blog-bento_text text-pretty mt-2">
3. <strong>Tariff Misconfigurations</strong>: Discrepancies can also arise from tariff changes or misconfigurations. If the Malawi Water Board does not update or program tariffs correctly, the meters might miscalculate the water volume for a given payment.
